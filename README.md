# React Native Mapbox GL Demo

Demo Application for [React Native Mapbox GL](../README.md)

## What is Mapbox?

Mapbox is the location data platform for mobile and web applications. We provide [building blocks](https://www.mapbox.com/products/) to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience you create. Use our simple and powerful APIs & SDKs and our open source libraries for interactivity and control.

## Sign up for Mapbox

Not a Mapbox user yet? [Sign up for an account here](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/). Once youâ€™re signed in, all you need to start building is a Mapbox access token. Use this same short code with all of our interactive mapping libraries, Python and JavaScript SDKs, and directly against our REST APIs. You can [create and manage your access tokens in Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/).

## Installation

* Make sure you are in the example directory
```
cd example
```
* Create a file called `accesstoken` in the root of the example project and just paste in your [Mapbox access token](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/).

* Install our dependencies using `npm i`.

## Start React Native Packager

Open up another tab in your Terminal and run
```
npm start
```

## Run Android Simulator

* Open up Android Studio and build with gradle
* Start Android emulator
* Run `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` to foward port to packager(needed for hot reloading, if you're not developing you can skip this step).
* Run `react-native run-android` from `example` directory


**NOTE**

If the build fails make sure gradle has permission to build from cli
```
cd android
chmod +x gradlew
```

## Run iOS Simulator

You can run this with the react-native cli or Xcode

```
react-native run-ios
```

**NOTE**

If you run into

```
Command failed: /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c Print:CFBundleIdentifier build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/RNMapboxGLExample.app/Info.plist
Print: Entry, ":CFBundleIdentifier", Does Not Exist
```

Just run the example from Xcode, it seems to be an [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14423) with RN.
